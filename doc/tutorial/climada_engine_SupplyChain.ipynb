    "After loading the MRIOT, one needs to translate the direct impacts previously calculated, which are defined at an arbitrary spatial resolution, into impacts to sectors and countries defined by the MRIOT. To do this one needs to know what countries and sectors are modeled by the used exposure. The first is straightforward, as exposure contains latitude and longitude information, and even a regional id that often defines the country of interest. The latter needs input from the user, who needs to know/assess what sectors in the MRIOT is the used exposure representative of. For example, assuming the `LitPop`exposure is representative of the service sector, and assuming that sub-sectors at positions 26 to 56 in `WIOD16` do represent this sector, then one can translate spatially disaggregated impacts into country/sector impacts as follows:"

    "Which creates the attributes `self.secs_exp`, `self.secs_imp`, and `self.secs_shock`. The first two show `Exposure` and `Impact` values at the country-sector level. This translation is accomplished assuming that exposure (impact) of an affected sector is proportional to the contribution of this sector to the overall production of all affected sectors. For example, if the total (spatially distributed) exposed value is 100, and there are two affected sectors, A (whose production is 2) and B (whose production is 8); then sector A has an exposure of 20 and sector B has an exposure of 80.
